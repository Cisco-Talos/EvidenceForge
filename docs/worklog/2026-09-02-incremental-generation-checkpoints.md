# Incremental Generation Checkpoints

## Objective

Implement cadence-only crash-safe generation checkpoints whose foreground work depends on changes
since the previous checkpoint plus bounded live state, not all historical generator state. Resume
must remain portable and byte-identical, and the selected default cadence must add no more than 5%
median wall time on every representative workload, including a 60-day scenario.

## Branch history

- This implementation starts from clean `dev` commit `a530d9d91` on
  `codex/generation-checkpoints`.
- The rejected full-snapshot experiment is preserved remotely on
  `origin/codex/generation-checkpoints-full-snapshot` at `c21eeeda5`.
- That experiment established the CLI/safety requirements and proved byte-identical recovery, but
  its full-history capture grew from 4.80 foreground seconds after simulated hour one to 13.69
  seconds after hour three. Its projected 60-day cost was unacceptable.

## Locked decisions

- Checkpoints occur only at positive cadence multiples across the continuous warm-up and
  collection hour count. There are no forced initialization, phase-boundary, tail, or
  pre-finalization checkpoints.
- `--checkpoint-hours 0` disables checkpoint creation. A run interrupted before its first cadence
  point has no resumable recovery point.
- Active emitter spools stay in their current locations. Checkpoints import only new immutable
  runs, append chunks, or logical SQLite rows and restore protected spools freshly.
- Recovery points share content-addressed immutable segments. A checkpoint captures bounded live
  heads and seals only the delta since its predecessor; it never reprocesses older segments.
- The stdlib packed representation is the baseline. A third-party codec or store is retained only
  if it reduces checkpoint-path work by at least 20% and worst-workload total overhead by at least
  three percentage points without regressing another representative workload.
- No project version bump occurs on this feature branch.

## Acceptance record

Record implementation commits, schema decisions, fault results, byte-identity comparisons,
checkpoint-time growth at simulated hours 6/24/168/720/1440, codec/store trials, resource forecast
calibration, and the final three-pair performance matrix here. Do not reconcile the durable TODO
until every correctness and performance gate passes.

## Implementation record

- The initial store publishes canonical bounded heads and content-addressed immutable segments,
  retains two manifests, garbage-collects only unreferenced objects, validates recovery hashes,
  and falls back from a corrupt newest generation. Inherited segments are carried by reference
  and are not reopened or rehashed during a later commit.
- The cadence coordinator transactionally prepares explicit participants and advances their delta
  watermarks only after the manifest is durable. Failed publication aborts every prepared owner.
  No general object-graph encoder or fallback exists.
- Append-only spool adapters use logical names, committed lengths, fixed maximum chunk sizes, and
  chained SHA-256 records. A later checkpoint reads strictly from the prior committed length;
  focused coverage observed nine bytes on the initial seal and only five newly appended bytes on
  the next seal. Recovery validates the complete chain and recreates fresh files without storing
  runtime paths.
- Immutable external-sort run adapters import each logical run once. Later checkpoints skip every
  imported run without reopening it; recovery validates the content index and recreates the runs
  at fresh owner-selected locations.
