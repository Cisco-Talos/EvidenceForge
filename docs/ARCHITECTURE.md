# EvidenceForge Architecture

This document explains how EvidenceForge works — first at a high level for users, then in detail for contributors who want to extend it.

## Part 1: How It Works

### Two-Phase Hybrid Architecture

EvidenceForge uses a two-phase approach that combines LLM flexibility with deterministic reliability:

```
Phase 1: Scenario Creation (LLM-Assisted)
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  Claude Code Skills guide interactive authoring   |
|  - Research TTPs via MITRE ATT&CK                |
|  - Interview user about environment & attack      |
|  - Output: validated YAML scenario file           |
+--------------------------------------------------+
                     |
                     v
Phase 2: Log Generation (Deterministic)
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  eforge CLI executes the scenario plan            |
|  - No LLM calls, no API costs                    |
|  - Reproducible output (seeded RNG)              |
|  - Output: correlated multi-format log files      |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

This separation means scenario creation benefits from LLM reasoning about attack techniques, while generation is fast, cheap, and reproducible.

### Consistency by Construction

The core architectural principle is that **two emitters cannot disagree about shared fields because there is only one source of truth.**

A `SecurityEvent` object carries all the data for one logical evidence-producing
occurrence. Multiple contexts on that event describe facets of the same occurrence
when those facts must agree across sources. For example, a process-created
occurrence can carry `AuthContext`, `ProcessContext`, and `EdrContext` so Windows,
Sysmon, and endpoint telemetry render the same PID, LogonID, parent, image, and
actor identity.

Multi-phase activities are modeled one level higher, as action bundles. An action
bundle represents a real-world activity that can produce several coordinated
`SecurityEvent`s. For example, an SSH session may produce transport connection
evidence, SSH auth syslog messages, endpoint `USER_SESSION` login/logout rows,
sshd/bash process evidence, bash history commands, and close/teardown evidence.
The bundle owns lifecycle, timing constraints, observation intent, and durable
anchors across those events; each `SecurityEvent` remains the canonical evidence
unit dispatched to state and emitters.

`SecurityEvent.timestamp` is canonical world time. Source-native timestamps are
planned separately by `SourceTimingPlanner`
(`src/evidenceforge/generation/source_timing.py`) and stored on
`SecurityEvent.source_timing` during dispatch. Migrated emitters ask the planner
for a source time with explicit bounds instead of adding independent jitter
locally. Causally related rows are constrained (`A < B` within one source
stream), equal canonical timestamps are ordered only when a relationship requires
it, and independent events may still share source timestamps. Across different
source families there is no global total order; each source is responsible for
preserving its own causal order with stable, explainable offsets.

The temporal constraint graph
(`src/evidenceforge/generation/timing/constraint_graph.py`) is the internal
foundation for multi-event timing. It resolves preferred timestamps, hard
not-before/not-after bounds, lifecycle windows, and directed "after this evidence
by at least this gap" relationships deterministically. `SourceTimingPlanner`
already uses this graph for paired source rows and "source after source" timing;
future action bundles should use it when one activity produces dependent
`SecurityEvent`s whose source-native observations must not invert.

```

### Network Visibility Modeling

EvidenceForge models where network sensors are placed and what traffic they can observe:

- **SPAN ports** see all traffic in their monitored segments (including intra-segment)
- **TAP sensors** only see traffic crossing segment boundaries
- **Direction** controls whether a sensor sees inbound, outbound, or both

When a network connection event is dispatched, the NetworkVisibilityEngine determines which sensors can observe it based on the source/destination IPs and sensor placement. Only sensors with visibility produce log entries for that connection.

**Network Address Translation:** When firewall sensors have `nat_rules`, the dispatcher computes NAT translations for permitted cross-boundary connections. The `NatContext` on `SecurityEvent` carries mapped IPs. The ASA emitter renders both real and mapped addresses (305011/305012 + parenthesized IPs in Built messages). Zeek emitters swap IPs for post-NAT sensors via `_nat_swaps_by_sensor`, so inside sensors see real IPs while outside sensors see translated IPs.

## Part 2: Internals (For Contributors)

### SecurityEvent Canonical Model

The `SecurityEvent` dataclass (`src/evidenceforge/events/base.py`) is the central data structure:

```
SecurityEvent
├── timestamp: datetime (UTC)
├── event_type: str ("logon", "process_create", "connection", ...)
├── src_host: HostContext (originating system — hostname, IP, OS, domain, FQDN)
├── dst_host: HostContext (target system — hostname, IP, OS, domain, FQDN)
├── auth: AuthContext (logon_id, logon_type, SID, failure codes)
├── process: ProcessContext (pid, parent_pid, image, command_line, start_time)
├── remote_thread: RemoteThreadContext (target_pid, new_thread_id, start_address)
├── network: NetworkContext (src/dst IP/port, protocol, zeek_uid, bytes)
├── dns: DnsContext (query, type, response, TTL)
├── file: FileContext (path, hash, operation)
├── registry: RegistryContext (key, value, operation)
├── ids: IdsContext (signature, severity, classification)
├── syslog: SyslogContext (app_name, message, pid, facility, severity)
├── weird: WeirdContext (name, notice, peer, source)
├── kerberos: KerberosContext (ticket_type, service, encryption)
├── shell: ShellContext (command)
├── ... (27 context types total)
├── source_timing: SourceTimingPlan (planned source-native timestamps)
└── _sensor_hostnames_by_format: dict (network visibility metadata)
```

All contexts are `@dataclass(slots=True)` for memory efficiency. They're defined in `src/evidenceforge/events/contexts.py`.

**Key design decisions:**
- Host context uses a dual `src_host`/`dst_host` model — `src_host` is the system that originates or performs the action; `dst_host` is the target or receiver. For single-host events only one is set; for network events both may be set when both endpoints are known
- Contexts are composable — a logon event has Host + Auth + Syslog contexts; a process event has Host + Process + Syslog contexts
- Contexts describe facets of one occurrence. They must not be used to pack a
  whole multi-phase activity into one event. If connection, auth, session open,
  process creation, command execution, and session close are distinct occurrences,
  coordinate them with an action bundle and emit distinct `SecurityEvent`s.
- All fields are optional except `timestamp` and `event_type` — emitters check for the contexts they need
- The syslog emitter renders from SyslogContext (app_name, message, pid, facility, severity). All syslog message construction is done by ActivityGenerator, not the emitter.
- `RawLogEntry` exists solely for the user-facing `raw` event type in scenario YAML. All internal engine code uses canonical SecurityEvent dispatch exclusively

### Action Bundles

Action bundles sit between world/storyline/baseline intent and canonical
`SecurityEvent` dispatch:

```
intent -> action bundle -> lifecycle/timing/observation -> SecurityEvents -> dispatcher/state/emitters
```

The source of intent can be a storyline event, background/persona scheduler,
red-herring generator, or scanner/noise generator. The evidence construction path
should still be shared. A storyline SSH session, baseline SSH admin session, and
suspicious-but-benign SSH red herring should use the same SSH action-bundle
semantics instead of hand-rolling separate timing, session, syslog, endpoint, and
Zeek behavior.

SSH bundle callers may supply different intent sources, such as typed storyline
events, baseline remote-admin noise, or storyline `scp` transfers to modeled
Linux receivers. The bundle keeps an intent anchor for durable narrative
references and a resolved execution anchor after source-port reservation, so two
otherwise identical SSH sessions do not collapse when the network tuple differs.
Transfer-specific receiver artifacts, such as the target-side file create for
`scp`, are emitted after the bundle-owned SSH lifecycle rather than duplicating
SSH auth or transport timing locally.

RDP bundle callers supply one remote interactive Windows session intent. The
`RdpSessionActionBundle` materializes source-side `mstsc.exe` when a modeled
source host is available, emits the TCP/3389 transport through canonical
connection generation, and emits the target Type 10 logon after source-visible
transport evidence. The bundle keeps source port, target session metadata,
transport PID, network close time, and source-ready timing aligned so storyline,
world-planner, and baseline RDP paths do not independently invent partial RDP
evidence.

Windows remote-admin callers supply explicit credential use or service-install
intent. `ExplicitCredentialUseActionBundle` owns source-host 4648 evidence:
subject-session selection, caller-process materialization or validation, source
endpoint semantics, and source-visible ordering after the caller process.
`WindowsServiceInstallActionBundle` owns service-control/service-install
evidence: companion SMB/RPC transport, dropped service-binary file creation when
applicable, and the target 4697/service context. Tool-specific storyline choices
such as `runas`, `PsExec`, `wmic`, and `schtasks` remain intent inputs rather
than separate evidence-generation paths.

Explicit forward proxy callers likewise supply one logical client-to-origin HTTP
or HTTPS request, and `ProxyTransactionActionBundle` expands it into the
source-native evidence that real sensors would see: client-to-proxy connection
and proxy access rows, optional CONNECT tunnel setup/reuse, terminal deny or
cache-hit behavior, proxy-origin DNS, and proxy-to-origin egress. The bundle owns
the timing constraint that origin-side activity cannot become visible before the
client-side proxy request would be source-visible. Proxy route selection and
format-specific rendering stay outside the bundle.

Network-connection callers supply one logical connection occurrence, and
`NetworkConnectionActionBundle` owns the internal boundary around tuple identity,
source/destination host semantics, source-port allocation, hostname/DNS/TLS/HTTP
and file metadata, proxy/firewall/IDS/EDR flow correlation, packet accounting,
visibility handoff, Zeek UID/state identity, source endpoint process ownership,
and Windows WFP companions. Higher-level bundles still call the public
`generate_connection()` compatibility entrypoint, but connection truth is routed
through this shared bundle boundary before becoming one canonical
`SecurityEvent` plus any source-native companion evidence.

DHCP callers supply one acquisition or renewal transaction, and
`DhcpLeaseActionBundle` owns lease identity, MAC/IP/server/domain metadata, Zeek
DHCP plus connection fan-out, link-local visibility semantics, and Linux
`dhclient` syslog companion ordering. Baseline warm-up leases, periodic renewal,
and typed storyline `dhcp_lease` events share this path so setup state and
visible lease evidence do not diverge.

DNS prerequisite callers supply one resolver lookup intent, and
`DnsLookupActionBundle` owns resolver selection, DNS cache behavior,
query/answer semantics, TTL observations, Zeek DNS plus UDP/53 connection
fan-out, Sysmon DNS visibility, AD SRV discovery companions, and low-volume
resolver companion questions. Storyline DNS-family events remain narrative
events, while connection prerequisites use this shared lookup path so DNS
answers, connection destinations, TLS SNI, and proxy hostnames stay aligned.

Browser-session callers supply one browser visit intent, and
`BrowserSessionActionBundle` expands it into page-load and subresource requests
with grouped TCP flow accounting, HTTP transaction depths, referrer chains,
static-asset cache suppression, response MIME/status metadata, and per-request
timing. The bundle emits each request through canonical connection generation, so
the same browser-session path works for direct network evidence and for hosts
whose traffic is handed to `ProxyTransactionActionBundle` by explicit proxy
routing. Tool-like HTTP requests and raw storyline HTTP events remain single
canonical events unless they are intentionally modeled as browser sessions.

Scanner/probe callers supply one scan/probe intent, and scanner action bundles
expand it into the relevant probe requests while preserving the canonical
network-connection boundary. `PortScanActionBundle` owns typed storyline
port-scan target fan-out, scan timing, open/closed service profiles, firewall
denial contexts, and ground-truth summaries. `WebScanActionBundle` owns typed
storyline web-scanner path selection, request timing, scanner user-agent
rendering, referrer rules, HTTP status/body metadata, IDS alert selection, and
Zeek/web-access correlation. `ScheduledScanOverlapActionBundle` covers
suspicious-but-benign scanner noise, and `NmapCommandProbeActionBundle` covers
network probes caused by modeled nmap processes.

File-transfer callers supply transfer intent layered on top of a transport path.
`HttpResponseFileTransferActionBundle` and `SmbFileTransferMetadataActionBundle`
build Zeek files.log metadata, FUIDs, analyzers, hashes, MIME types, filenames,
byte counts, transfer direction, and optional PE analysis from one transfer
description. `StagedArchiveSmbReadActionBundle` emits the SMB read that moves a
staged archive before exfiltration, and `ScpReceiverFileActionBundle` emits only
the receiver-side endpoint file evidence after the SSH bundle owns transport,
auth, and session timing. This keeps transport/session ownership separate from
file evidence while preventing each caller from inventing transfer metadata
independently.

Linux shell-command callers supply one interactive shell command intent.
`LinuxShellCommandActionBundle` owns the execution sequence around bash history:
activity-key-to-command resolution, SSH/session-readiness alignment,
per-user/per-host history scheduling, bash-history event emission, and optional
foreground process telemetry through existing process helpers. The current slice
keeps command pools, lifecycle clamps, and process side-effect builders as
adapter hooks while moving the orchestration boundary above individual
`SecurityEvent`s.

Process-execution callers supply one process create or process terminate intent.
`ProcessExecutionActionBundle` and `ProcessTerminationActionBundle` own the
internal boundary around canonical process lifecycle evidence: parent/session
ownership, source-visible create/terminate timing, command-owned network
effects, guaranteed process-image file evidence, and probabilistic
file/module/registry endpoint side effects. The current slice keeps the detailed
identity repair and side-effect builders in the activity-generator adapter so
existing callers, emitters, and public scenario behavior remain stable while
other bundles gain one shared process lifecycle path.

Auth/session callers supply successful logon, failed logon, or logoff intent.
`LogonActionBundle`, `FailedLogonActionBundle`, and `LogoffActionBundle` own the
internal boundary around session lifecycle evidence: session allocation and
reuse, logon ID and source endpoint ownership, Linux SSH syslog companions,
Windows DC validation evidence, failed-auth network companions, and session
termination ordering after dependent activity. The current slice keeps the
detailed source-native field selection in the activity-generator adapter so
existing storyline, baseline, world-planner, and higher-level bundle callers
share one stable auth/session path.

Action bundles own cross-event concerns:

- Deterministic action anchors for durable references.
- Lifecycle intervals and state ownership for sessions, processes, connections,
  leases, file transfers, and proxy transactions.
- Temporal constraints across dependent evidence.
- Observation intent and source-family eligibility.
- Expansion into one or more canonical `SecurityEvent`s.

`SecurityEvent` remains the shared truth unit underneath the bundle. Emitters still
receive only canonical events and source-local render rules; they do not inspect or
execute action bundles directly.

### WorldModel and WorldPlanner

The compiled world-model layer (`src/evidenceforge/generation/world_model.py`) sits above the canonical event model and answers the realism question the event model does not: "why would this user/system do this here?"

- `WorldModel` compiles canonical host capabilities and user placement from scenario fields such as `user.primary_system`, `system.assigned_user`, `system.roles`, and `system.services`
- `WorldPlanner` centralizes session bootstrap for interactive, network, SSH, and RDP access, including remote source-host selection and planner-owned session allocation
- Baseline and storyline call this shared layer instead of maintaining separate SSH/RDP/logon heuristics
- `ActivityGenerator` then emits host/network evidence against that precomputed state using the canonical `SecurityEvent` pipeline

### EventDispatcher

The dispatcher (`src/evidenceforge/events/dispatcher.py`) routes events through two layers:

```
SecurityEvent
    │
    ├──▶ StateManager.apply(event)    [side effects: session/process/connection state]
    │
    ├──▶ Layer 1: Format Eligibility
    │    emitter.can_handle(event)     [checks event_type + required contexts]
    │
    └──▶ Layer 2: Network Visibility   [for network events only]
         Which sensors see this traffic?
         Sets _sensor_hostnames_by_format metadata
         │
         ▼
    Matching emitters receive the event
```

**Format groups** expand shorthand names: `"zeek"` expands to 13 individual emitters (zeek_conn, zeek_dns, zeek_http, etc.).

### StateManager

`StateManager` (`src/evidenceforge/generation/state_manager.py`) is the single source of truth for runtime state:

```
StateManager
├── Active Sessions    {logon_id → ActiveSession}
│   └── username, system, logon_type, explorer_pid, process_tree_root
├── Running Processes  {(system, pid) → RunningProcess}
│   └── pid, parent_pid, image, command_line, integrity_level
├── Open Connections   {conn_id → OpenConnection}
│   └── src/dst IP/port, protocol, zeek_uid, bytes, state
├── DNS Cache          {hostname → IP}
├── Boot Times         {system → datetime} (entity lifecycle validation)
└── Current Time       datetime (advances during generation)
```

**ID allocation pattern:**
1. `WorldPlanner` or `ActivityGenerator` calls `state_manager.create_session()` / `create_process()` / `open_connection()` to allocate durable IDs and ownership metadata
2. `ActivityGenerator` builds a `SecurityEvent` with those IDs
3. Dispatches the event
4. `StateManager.apply()` records state from the event (teardown, byte updates — never allocates IDs)

**Zeek UID correlation:** All Zeek log types for the same network connection share a `zeek_uid` stored on `OpenConnection`. This is the critical cross-log correlation key — conn.log, dns.log, http.log, ssl.log all reference the same UID.

**Thread safety:** RLock protects all public methods. Lock hold times are typically <1ms. Thread-local RNG (seeded by thread ID) ensures reproducibility across concurrent generation.

### Emitter Architecture

All emitters inherit from `LogEmitter` (`src/evidenceforge/generation/emitters/base.py`):

```
LogEmitter (ABC)
├── _supported_types: set[str]       # Which event types this emitter handles
├── can_handle(event) → bool         # Format eligibility check
├── emit(event: SecurityEvent)       # New path: type-safe, context-aware
├── emit_event(data: dict)           # Legacy path: raw dict rendering
├── emit_raw(entry: RawLogEntry)     # Escape hatch (user `raw` event type only)
├── _buffer: list                    # 10K event buffer before flush
└── _flush()                         # Write buffer to file
│
├── WindowsEventEmitter              # Security XML (default) or Snare syslog (sof-elk)
├── SysmonEventEmitter               # Sysmon XML (default) or Snare syslog (sof-elk)
├── ZeekEmitter                      # conn.log (base for 13 Zeek types)
│   ├── ZeekDnsEmitter               # dns.log
│   ├── ZeekHttpEmitter              # http.log
│   ├── ZeekSslEmitter               # ssl.log
│   └── ... (10 more Zeek types)
├── EcarEmitter                      # eCAR NDJSON (MITRE CAR model, objectID/actorID graph via EdrContext)
├── SyslogEmitter                    # Linux syslog (default RFC5424 or sof-elk RFC3164/year)
├── BashHistoryEmitter               # Per-user bash history
├── SnortEmitter                     # Snort IDS alerts
├── CiscoAsaEmitter                  # Cisco ASA firewall syslog (Built/Teardown/Deny)
├── WebEmitter                       # Apache/Nginx access logs
└── ProxyEmitter                     # HTTP forward proxy access logs (W3C Extended)
```

**Output target policy:** `eforge generate --target default|sof-elk` selects
target-specific rendering only where a consuming tool needs a different shape.
Scenario YAML and `--formats` stay canonical. `OUTPUT_TARGET.txt` records the
selected target beside `GROUND_TRUTH.md`; missing markers are treated as
legacy/default during evaluation.

**Sensor multiplexing:** Network emitters (Zeek family, Snort, Cisco ASA) use `SensorMultiplexEmitter` to route output to per-sensor directories. A single emitter instance manages output for multiple sensors. Zeek/Snort write to `<sensor_hostname>/<log_file>`; Cisco ASA is syslog-family output and writes to `<sensor_hostname>/cisco_asa.log` for the default target or `<sensor_hostname>/<year>/cisco_asa.log` for the SOF-ELK target. The CiscoAsaEmitter also generates deny baseline traffic from the firewall sensor's policy rules.

**Browser and proxy path modeling:** `BrowserSessionActionBundle` owns browser-like page sessions for outbound persona traffic and inbound human visitor traffic: request grouping, transaction depth, subresource timing, referrers, static-asset cache suppression, response MIME/status metadata, and generated HTTP contexts. Each planned request still enters `ActivityGenerator.generate_connection()`, preserving the same canonical connection, DNS, TLS, Zeek HTTP/files, web-access, and proxy behavior as a direct single request. `environment.proxy.mode` controls whether proxy-routed HTTP/HTTPS keeps transparent client→origin network evidence or is split into explicit client→proxy and proxy→origin legs. Explicit mode routes each logical client→origin request through `ProxyTransactionActionBundle`, which dispatches each concrete leg through the normal sensor visibility engine so Zeek/IDS/firewall sources only contain the side of the proxy they can observe; the original logical client→origin request is not emitted as network evidence. Denied proxy requests emit only the client→proxy/proxy access evidence and do not create downstream origin-side transactions. Cache hits likewise stop at client/proxy evidence. Allowed cache misses plan the client proxy-request visibility window and proxy→origin egress through the temporal constraint graph so origin-side evidence cannot appear before the client-side proxy request would be source-visible. Proxy access rows include an `x-proxy-action` cue such as `tunnel-setup`, `ssl-inspect`, `forward`, or `deny` so decrypted HTTPS rows are distinguishable from raw CONNECT tunnel rows.

**Threading:** Each emitter optionally runs in a background thread with a bounded queue (50K max). Hour-level flush barriers ensure temporal consistency.

**Two rendering paths:**
- `emit(SecurityEvent)` — primary path for all event types (storyline + baseline)
- `emit_event(dict)` — legacy path for user `raw` event type in scenario YAML only

### Format Definition System

Log formats are defined declaratively in YAML files (`src/evidenceforge/formats/definitions/`), not in code:

```yaml
# Example: zeek_conn.yaml

Each format YAML defines fields (name, type, constraints), event variants (for multi-event formats like Windows Security), and Jinja2 output templates. Adding a new log format requires:
1. A new YAML definition in `formats/definitions/`
2. An emitter class in `generation/emitters/`
3. A parser class in `evaluation/parsers/` (for eval support)

### Evaluation Engine

Causal ordering rules are defined in `evaluation/rules/causal_pairs.yaml`. Rules support several evaluation features:

- **Grace period:** Events within the scenario's `logon_grace_period` (default 30m) from scenario start are exempt from causal ordering checks, since data collection begins mid-session with pre-existing user sessions.
- **Per-rule tolerance:** Rules can specify a `tolerance` fraction (e.g., 0.03 for DNS→TCP) allowing a percentage of failures without penalty. Used for intentional direct-IP baseline connections.
- **Account exclusions:** Rules list system accounts (SYSTEM, root, www-data, etc.) exempt from logon-before-process checks, since daemons run from boot without interactive logins.
- **Format groups:** Trace coverage uses format groups (host-local vs network) instead of checking all formats. Connection events expect traces in both groups; process/logon events only expect host-local traces.
- **Typed event detection:** Signal integrity uses typed EventSpec fields to identify event types instead of keyword-matching activity descriptions, with 15 record matchers covering all event types.

### Scenario Models

The Pydantic model hierarchy (`src/evidenceforge/models/scenario.py`):

```
Scenario (root)
├── environment: Environment
│   ├── timezone: TimeZone (default + system overrides)
│   ├── users: list[User] (username, email, persona, primary_system)
│   ├── systems: list[System] (hostname, IP, OS, type, services)
│   ├── groups: list[Group] (name, members, permissions)
│   └── network: NetworkConfig (optional)
│       ├── segments: list[NetworkSegment] (name, CIDR, systems)
│       └── sensors: list[NetworkSensor] (type, placement, direction, formats)
├── personas: list[Persona] (activities, work_hours, risk_profile)
├── time_window: TimeWindow (start, end/duration)
├── baseline_activity: BaselineActivity (intensity, variation)
├── storyline: list[StorylineEvent]
│   └── events: list[EventSpec] (discriminated union)
│       ├── ProcessEventSpec
│       ├── LogonEventSpec
│       ├── ConnectionEventSpec
│       ├── SshSessionEventSpec
│       └── ... (15+ event types)
└── output: OutputSpec (formats, destination)
```

**Storyline events** use a discriminated union — each event in the `events` list has a `type` field that selects a specific Pydantic model with validated per-type fields.

### Validation

Three layers of validation (`src/evidenceforge/validation/schema.py`):

1. **Pydantic schema validation** — types, formats, patterns, constraints
2. **Cross-reference validation** — users reference valid personas, storyline actors exist, systems have valid IPs, network segments are consistent
3. **Generation-time checks** — OS compatibility, builtin account validation

Builtin accounts (SYSTEM, root, NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, etc.) are always valid as storyline actors without being defined in the users list.

### Causal Expansion Engine

The `CausalExpansionEngine` (`src/evidenceforge/generation/causal/`) centralizes the logic for auto-generating prerequisite and consequent events. Instead of scattering DNS-before-connection checks, Kerberos TGT/TGS emission, and command-line pattern inference across ActivityGenerator and StorylineMixin, all causal relationships are defined as composable `ExpansionRule` dataclasses in a flat registry.

```
ActivityGenerator.generate_connection()
    │
    ├──▶ _expand_and_emit("connection", ...)
    │        │
    │        ├──▶ CausalExpansionEngine.expand()
    │        │        │
    │        │        ├── DnsBeforeConnection        (priority 10)
    │        │        ├── KerberosBeforeLogon         (priority 20)
    │        │        ├── ProcessAccessAfterRemoteThread (priority 40)
    │        │        └── SupplementaryAuditEvents    (priority 60)
    │        │
    │        └──▶ For each ExpandedEvent:
    │             compute timing offset → call generate_*()
    │             (recursion guard: _expanding flag prevents re-expansion)
    │
    └──▶ Build SecurityEvent → dispatch
```

**Key components:**
- `ExpansionRule` (ABC) — `matches(event_type, ctx) → bool` + `expand(event_type, ctx) → list[ExpandedEvent]`
- `ExpansionContext` — carries event params + engine state (DNS cache, Kerberos cache, SID registry, skip_types)
- `TimingSpec` — `(min_ms, max_ms, position: "before"|"after")` sampled from
  `config/activity/timing_profiles.yaml` for realistic inter-event timing
- `CausalExpansionEngine` — evaluates all matching rules, sorts by timing (before-events first), returns ordered list

The timing profile file is overlay-aware. Causal prerequisites, source latency,
teardown margins, source-observation profiles, and Windows/Sysmon same-timestamp
collision spacing are data-driven so tuning can happen at the relationship class
without hardcoding one global delay. Source timing profiles are sampled through
`SourceTimingPlanner`, which clamps sampled source latency to relationship bounds
before emitters render. Network sensor rows add stable per-sensor clock skew,
path delay, and bounded capture noise so two Zeek sensors may see the same flow
at slightly different times while keeping each sensor stream internally causal.

**Currently registered rules:**

| Rule | Trigger | Emits | Timing |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| `DnsBeforeConnection` | TCP connection (not port 53) | DNS query (UDP/53) | `network.dns_before_tcp` timing profile |
| `KerberosBeforeLogon` | Kerberos-auth Windows logon (not on DC) | TGT (4768) + TGS (4769) | `auth.kerberos_before_logon` timing profile; elevated-session 4672 remains tied to the target-host 4624 |
| `ProcessAccessAfterRemoteThread` | CreateRemoteThread targeting lsass | ProcessAccess (Sysmon 10) before the remote thread | `process.remote_thread_lsass_access` timing profile |
| `SupplementaryAuditEvents` | Process creation with admin commands | 4720/4726/4728/4697/4698/1102 | `windows.audit_from_admin_command` timing profile |

**Adding a new rule:** Create a new `ExpansionRule` subclass in `rules.py`, implement `matches()` and `expand()`, and add it to `default_rules()` in `registry.py`. The engine auto-creates with defaults — no wiring needed in ActivityGenerator or GenerationEngine.

**Recursion prevention:** The `_expanding` flag on ActivityGenerator prevents expansion-generated events from re-expanding (e.g., DNS query → connection → DNS query → ∞).

### Baseline Realism

The baseline generation engine includes several layers of realism beyond simple random event emission:

**Hawkes self-exciting temporal model:** User baseline events are distributed using a Hawkes process (`src/evidenceforge/utils/timing.py:hawkes_timestamps()`) — a self-exciting point process where each event temporarily increases the probability of more events nearby. Parameters are derived from persona `risk_profile` (not hardcoded per persona name), so new personas work automatically. Cross-hour state continuity prevents artificial gaps at hour boundaries. System/service traffic uses `periodic_timestamps()` with deterministic phase + jitter instead.

**Storyline typing cadence:** Multi-event storyline steps space events with human typing rhythm (`typing_cadence()`) — Gaussian inter-action delays (~1.5s mean) with 15% chance of thinking pauses (3-12s). Single-event steps are unaffected.

**Day-of-week variation:** Activity multipliers scale by weekday (Monday 1.15x login storms → Friday 0.85x early departures → Saturday/Sunday 0.05-0.08x near-zero). Non-IT personas are skipped entirely on weekends; only sysadmin, security_analyst, and help_desk remain active.

**Stale account enrichment:** Disabled accounts generate four types of evidence: failed network logons (15%/hour), Kerberos pre-auth failures on DC (5%/hour, status 0x12 KDC_ERR_CLIENT_REVOKED), scheduled task failures with batch logon (3%/hour), and service startup failures at scenario start (2%, first hour only).

**Legitimate lateral movement:** 26 patterns of inter-server traffic are auto-generated based on environment topology — backup agents, monitoring, AD replication, app-to-database connections, config management, etc. Patterns are conditional on the infrastructure (file servers, DCs, Linux hosts) and gated by time-of-day (app traffic peaks during business hours, backup traffic peaks overnight).

**Network-level red herrings:** Three suspicious-but-benign network patterns supplement the existing host-level red herrings: high-entropy DNS queries to CDNs/DoH providers, unusual outbound connections to dev tools/cloud regions/backup sync, and scheduled vulnerability scan bursts.

**Entity lifecycle validation:** StateManager tracks per-system boot times and validates that process injection events (Sysmon 8/10) target existing PIDs. Warnings are logged for impossible sequences without blocking generation.

**DNS before baseline connections:** System traffic TCP connections (SMB, Kerberos, LDAP, database) emit DNS queries via the causal expansion engine before each connection, with per-host DNS caching (TTL 60-600s) preventing duplicate queries. ~2% of connections are intentionally direct-IP to simulate hardcoded infrastructure configs. Scenario system IP→FQDN mappings are registered at setup time so DNS queries resolve to correct hostnames. All domain↔IP data lives in a single `dns_registry.yaml` (source of truth). The loader (`dns_registry.py`) builds REVERSE_DNS, FORWARD_DNS, and tag-based lookups. All external connections use domain-first selection via `pick_domain_and_ip()` — hostname is resolved once at the top of `generate_connection()` and shared by causal DNS expansion, SSL SNI, and proxy rendering. Background HTTPS traffic (Windows Update, Ubuntu packages, CRL checks) uses tag-based selection from the same registry. Storyline connections to raw C2 IPs skip DNS emission (realistic for direct-IP C2 beaconing).

**Per-system session management:** `WorldPlanner` checks for active sessions on the specific target system before generating processes. If no session exists, it bootstraps a context-aware session (interactive for a user's primary workstation, network for remote process execution, SSH for Linux admin access, RDP for Windows remote admin). This prevents processes appearing on systems where the user has no corresponding logon/session evidence and keeps session ownership consistent across baseline and storyline paths.

**Process→network correlation:** Baseline process creation triggers correlated network connections when the executable normally generates traffic (browsers→HTTPS, Office→cloud, DB clients→SQL, dev tools→registries). 60% emission probability with process PID carried for eCAR FLOW correlation.

**Linux syslog depth:** Linux hosts generate 18 categories of syslog messages including SSH login/key exchange (70% key / 30% password), package management (apt-daily / dnf-automatic), systemd timer execution, logrotate file detail, and journald statistics — alongside existing systemd lifecycle, cron, UFW, logind, snapd, NTP, and other daemon messages.

**Centralized image path resolution:** `resolve_image_path(exe_basename, os_category)` in `application_catalog.py` is the single source of truth for bare-name → full-path resolution. All fallback code paths (parent chain creation, connection process creation, Sysmon rendering) call this instead of hardcoding System32. The function checks the application catalog first (user apps → Program Files/AppData), then a curated set of known system binaries (→ System32), and only uses System32 as a last resort for truly unknown executables.

**Persona-aware application filtering:** The application catalog enforces role-appropriate software distribution. Each app declares which personas may use it (e.g., kubectl → `[developer, sysadmin]`). The legacy `PROCESS_TEMPLATES` fallback is restricted to `process_system` only — user app/code/build/query categories always go through the persona-filtered catalog path.

**Bidirectional traffic profiles:** Role-based traffic profiles in `traffic_profiles.yaml` define both `outbound` (connections the host initiates) and `inbound` (connections the host receives). The `role` field names the other end of the connection in both directions. Inbound traffic flows through the same visibility engine and firewall policy evaluation as outbound — DMZ hosts receive external HTTPS traffic while internal servers only receive connections from other internal roles. The unified `_resolve_role()` method handles both directions, resolving role names to concrete IPs while excluding the local host.

**Command pool diversification:** Process templates use `{placeholder}` syntax across all categories (not just queries). Parameterized values include project paths, solution names, document names, build configs, Git branches, and internal URLs. `{username}` substitution provides per-user path affinity.

**Rule-based process trees:** Parent-child relationships are defined in `src/evidenceforge/generation/activity/spawn_rules.yaml` — a data-driven mapping of which processes can spawn which children, with command-line templates, lifetime metadata (long/short), and spawn delay ranges. The `_resolve_parent()` method on ActivityGenerator transparently finds an existing valid parent from the user's process history or auto-creates intermediate chains (e.g., explorer→powershell→dotnet.exe) with realistic backward timing. Long-lived parents created early in the scenario (first 30 minutes) have a 70% chance of being registered as pre-existing (no Sysmon Event 1 emitted). Depth is limited to 3 auto-created levels. Falls back to legacy `_select_parent_pid()` for processes not in the rules. `ProcessContext.parent_command_line` is populated from the parent process's StateManager entry.

**PID allocation diversity:** PIDs use a lognormal distribution for gap sizes (Windows: `lognormvariate(1.2, 0.8)` in multiples of 4; Linux: `lognormvariate(0.5, 0.6)`), producing a heavy-tailed gap distribution with no fixed-set fingerprint. Wraparound at 65536 skips PIDs still held by running processes.

**Per-user bash history:** Baseline SSH sessions to Linux servers generate organic admin commands for realistic admin users, creating per-user `<username>.bash_history` files on all Linux hosts. Storyline process events inject 0-3 organic noise commands (pwd, ls, id, w, df -h, etc.) around each attack command via `generate_bash_command_with_noise()`.

### Key Patterns

**Thread-local RNG:** Each generation thread gets a `random.Random` instance seeded by `hash((thread_id, 42))`. This ensures reproducibility while enabling concurrent generation without GIL contention. LogonID generation uses per-host RNG seeding (`_stable_seed(f"logon_ids_{hostname}")`) to ensure unique LogonID sequences per system.

**Discriminated unions:** Storyline event specs use Pydantic discriminated unions — `type: "process"` selects `ProcessEventSpec`, `type: "logon"` selects `LogonEventSpec`, etc. This provides compile-time-like type safety for YAML input.

**Format groups:** The scenario declares `"zeek"` → the engine expands it to 13 individual emitters. Sensors reference format groups, not individual formats.

**Windows EventRecordID ordering:** Events are buffered as raw dicts, sorted by timestamp on flush, then assigned sequential EventRecordIDs. This matches real Windows behavior where RecordID always increases monotonically with time.
