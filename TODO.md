## Notes

- **Phase focus:** Start with Phase 1, complete each phase fully before moving to next
- **Testing:** Write tests alongside implementation, not after
- **Documentation:** Update docs incrementally, not all at end
- **Code review:** All major features should be reviewed before marking complete
- **Git workflow:** Commit frequently with clear messages, push to main or feature branches
- **Dependencies:** Add via `uv add`, never use `pip` directly
- **AGENTS.md compliance:** Follow all patterns and conventions specified in AGENTS.md
